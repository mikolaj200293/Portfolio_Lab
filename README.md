# Oddam w dobre ręce

"Oddam w dobre ręce" is an application that allows us to donate our unwanted items to charitable organizations that redistribute them to people in need.

Each user can create an account, thanks to which he gets access to a list of items and institutions to which these items can be donated. 

Through the form, one defines one's donation by specifying what the user wants to donate, in what quantity and to which institution. Finally, the user specifies the place and date of collection and comments for the courier. After confirming the data, the order is placed.

All the user's orders are archived in his profile.

The application has an administrator panel that allows the user to manage and enter new institutions and types of items that can be donated. 

Thanks to the application, the user can get rid of items that are no longer needed, which may turn out to be a priceless gift for others.
